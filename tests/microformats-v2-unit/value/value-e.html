<!--
    NOTE:
    Value-class parsing does not apply to e-properties. This test simply
    confirms that the implementation is not accidentally performing value-class
    processing where it should not.

    Also, the details of textContent processing are tested in a dedicated test
    series, thus here valid output is carefully designed to pass even if no
    trimming is performed.
